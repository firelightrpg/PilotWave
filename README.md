# The Fudge/ Fate Ladder

For conflict resolution, Pilot Wave uses an
expanded [ladder](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/taking-action-dice-ladder#the-ladder) of adjectives and numbers to rate
the attempt, the dice results plus modifiers against the difficulty, either a passive difficulty, set by the game
master, or an active opposition, the opponent’s dice results plus modifiers.
Roll [four fudge dice](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/taking-action-dice-ladder) (4DF) and add the result to the skill
rating to get the final attempt.

| Difficulty    | 4dF | Attempt       | Probability of Success |
|---------------|-----|---------------|------------------------|
| Certain       | \-4 | Abysmal       | 100                    |

# Pilot Wave Character Creation

<!-- TOC --><a name="pilot-wave-aspects"></a>

# Pilot Wave Aspects

Each player character starts with five aspects, chosen from an archetype, including one or more careers, trouble
aspects, convictions and ties. A player character also gets to choose three stunts, assign attributes and assign skills,
one Great (+4), two Good (+3), three Fair (+2) and four Average (+1).

<!-- TOC --><a name="archetype"></a>

## Archetype

Your archetype is your character’s [High Concept](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/your-character-idea#high-concept). Your
high concept is a phrase that sums up what your character is about. Here’s a list
of [example high concepts](https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Aspects_List#Archetypes_.2F_High_Concepts).

<!-- TOC --><a name="careers"></a>

## Career(s)

Each player character has a former career, or careers. These can be any manner of schooling or job training that result
in the set of skills and other aspects, aligning with the Archetype. Typically, most characters will only have one
career, but may have a career focus, or a significant shift in careers. Common careers include military, exploratory,
academic, law enforcement or agent, trader, extralegal or ship crew. Employers may be government, corporate or private.
You may wish to select your skill set first, then add a career justifying those choices, or the other way
around. [Sample careers](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Vocation)

<!-- TOC --><a name="trouble"></a>

## [Trouble](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/your-character-idea#trouble)

Every character has a troublesome aspect that’s part of their story.

<!-- TOC --><a name="convictions"></a>

## Convictions

Choose two convictions that guide your character’s decisions and role play. Here’s
some [examples of convictions](https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Aspects_List#Beliefs.2C_Convictions_.26_Mottos).

<!-- TOC --><a name="ties"></a>

## Ties

Choose two ties that inform your character’s patrons. These can be friend or foe, but define aspects of your character.

<!-- TOC --><a name="gear"></a>

## Gear

Choose one gear aspect, a military grade weapon or armor, a high tech level sensor, sensory implants, battlefield
computer, gravity belt, high tech medical scanner, high tech environment suit, combat drugs, truth drugs, energy weapon,
etc.

<!-- TOC --><a name="stunts"></a>

# [Stunts](https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/stunts)

Each player character gets three stunts. Stunts may be aspected, triggered, broad or
combined. [Examples](http://evilhat.wikidot.com/fate-core-stunts).

<!-- TOC --><a name="attributes"></a>

# [Attributes](https://fudgesrd.opengamingnetwork.com/fudgesrd/character-creation/character-creation-terms/)

Attributes in Pilot Wave help define the raw nature of the character, and serve as a catch-all when a challenge does not
represent training. Player characters have 3 shifts to distribute as desired for attributes.

<!-- TOC --><a name="physique"></a>

## Physique

Physique represents your physical strength, agility and stamina. Your physique determines the amount of physical stress
you can take. See Fate [Physique](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/physique).

## Psyche

Psyche represents your force of personality, serenity, presence and willpower. Retrying failed tasks often requires a
determination skill roll, and psyche is the relevant skill. Staying cool during a firefight or other hazard may require
a poise skill roll, and psyche is the relevant skill. Psyche determines the amount of mental stress you can take.

Tactics represents training in combat tactics, leadership and reconnaissance. Each side in a conflict has a Tactics
pool, the total of all Tactics skill points for each character. At the beginning of a conflict, each side may subtract a
number for their Tactics pool and apply it to their Tactics roll to determine side order. The remaining Tactics points
serve as one or more roving die modifiers, reset on each exchange. Attempting to counter an enemy's action is a contest,
where you attempt to overcome your opponent’s Tactics skill roll.

* Overcome: Use Tactics to overcome any obstacle related to enemy positions, movements or strength.
* Create an Advantage: Use Tactics to create advantages based on your understanding of combat tactics, building defenses
  or choosing the best locations for combat advantage.
* Attack: You may use Tactics directly for attacking, and it affects exchange order and counters.
* Defense: You may use your Tactics skill directly for defense, but you may create advantages based on your knowledge of
  defensible positions.

When you use a roving die modifier, subtract it from your tactics pool for that exchange. At the start of each exchange,
your tactics pool resets, minus the amount you used for determining side order. You may add a roving die modifier from
your side’s Tactics pool after the roll, but before knowing the outcome.

<!-- TOC --><a name="vehicle-combat"></a>

* Overcome: Use Zero-G to overcome any obstacle related to Zero-G environments and equipment.
* Create an Advantage: Use Zero-G to create advantages based on your understanding of Zero-G environments and equipment.
  The shift from acceleration induced gravity to Zero-G and vice versa can be very disorienting, especially for those
  untrained in Zero-G.

<!-- TOC --><a name="psychic-powers"></a>

# Psychic Powers

Psychic abilities are powers, not generally available to the public. Several secret organizations exist that research
and experiment on children, awakening various psychic phenomena. Psychic abilities are not generally innate, nor
acquired by training, outside of these experiments. Few survive the experiments, but those that do are highly valued and
feared. Once a person reaches adulthood without training, psychic abilities are no longer available. For unknown
reasons, only one power manifests in any psychic individual and power level is generally low, but sometimes spikes with
emotions. Manifesting a power can be used to overcome an obstacle, create an advantage, and some to attack or defend.

<!-- TOC --><a name="enhancements"></a>

### Enhancements

Psychic powers usually allow you to do something extraordinary, or in the simplest case, add a boost to an appropriate
skill check to overcome an obstacle.

<!-- TOC --><a name="jumper"></a>

## Jumper

Jumpers are able to teleport within a zone at will. Extreme focus or emotions can allow them to jump further, even
miles, but at a risk. Not all jumpers survive longer jumps...

<!-- TOC --><a name="mover"></a>

## Mover

Movers are telekinetics able to move small items they can see within a zone at will. Extreme focus or emotions can allow
a mover to move larger objects or even ward off physical attacks by erecting a telekinetic shield.

<!-- TOC --><a name="pusher"></a>

## Pusher

Pushers are telepaths that can push thoughts into another subject, who seemingly act as if they are their own. They are
some of the most feared psychics, as even a simple thought can lead to fatal actions or betrayal of allies. Some can
read thoughts, yankers, and may cause their targets to betray their secrets. Some have even been known as wipers, able
to erase memories...

<!-- TOC --><a name="shifter"></a>

## Shifter

Shifters are able to manifest photokinetic powers, creating a mirage, hiding objects or people in plain sight, or
passing off objects as something else, like a winning poker hand for a poor one. Shifters can also disrupt or blank
psychic power, able to prevent others from using their powers or shadow those with psychic abilities from Sniffs.

<!-- TOC --><a name="sniff"></a>

## Sniff

Sniffs are clairvoyants able to see images or scenes in real time, two to three zones away. Sniffs can also detect other
nearby psychics when they use their power.

<!-- TOC --><a name="watcher"></a>

## Watcher

Watchers are precogs that can see images or scenes from the future. The future is not fixed, so this can be a very
confusing and mentally disturbing ability. Near now events are much clearer and with focus, can provide seemingly
supernatural defensive advantages.

<!-- TOC --><a name="astrogation"></a>

# Astrogation

Navigation to and from nearby stars is limited to systems within two parsecs. To visualize the path, you can
use [In-The-Sky](https://in-the-sky.org/ngc3d.php). Fixed three dimensional maps can be viewed
at [atlasoftheuniverse](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/12lys.html).

Inducing a wormhole involves precise vector targeting of the destination, thereby limiting the range. Jump calculations
take 10 minutes on average. Travel through the wormhole throat uses the maneuver drive through non-Euclidean space.
Regardless of speed, exiting the wormhole takes about 5 days.

<!-- TOC --><a name="astrogation-attempt"></a>

## Astrogation attempt

- Legendary (+4): Instantaneous and flawless calculations (0 minutes)
- Superb (+3): Very quick and accurate calculations (2 minutes)
- Great (+2): Quick and reliable calculations (4 minutes)
- Good (+1): Efficient and generally accurate calculations (6 minutes)
- Fair (0): Average performance with room for improvement (10 minutes)
- Average (-1): Some errors or delays, but still manageable (12 minutes)
- Mediocre (-2): Significant errors or complications, requiring additional time to resolve (14 minutes)
- Poor (-3): Major mistakes or complications, significant time needed to rectify (16 minutes)
- Terrible (-4): Catastrophic failure, unable to complete, must start over (20 minutes or more consumed with the first
  effort)

Executing a jump at 100 or more diameters is Routine. Performing a jump from 10-100 diameters is Difficult. Closer
than 10 diameters is both Impossible and Hazardous.

WHIP (WormHole Induction Propulsion) or Jump drives can perform a two parsec jump, depleting the ship's power and
causing a radiation buildup on the reactor that must be dissipated in a gravity well of at least 0.1G for 10 hours.
Ships have fuel cells, solar cells or batteries to complete maneuver drive operations to a star port, gas giant or other
hydrogen source (like water) for refueling. Jumping to a system without a hydrogen source is a one way trip. Jumping to
a system without a gravity well will irradiate the crew unless the ship is abandoned.

A three parsec jump can be attempted, but it risks a loss of primary containment, immediately leading to a catastrophic
hydrogen explosion, destroying the ship and killing the crew.

<!-- TOC --><a name="system-travel"></a>

## System Travel

When traveling at a constant velocity, turning over at midpoint and constantly decelerating to the destination, travel
time is expressed as the following formula, where T is travel time in days, D is distance in thousands of
kilometers and A is acceleration in Gs.

$$
T = \sqrt{\frac{D}{A}/32.4}
$$

<!-- TOC --><a name="surprise"></a>

## Surprise

In Pilot Wave, at the beginning of a conflict, Surprise is determined by invoking a Situation Aspect or a Character
Aspect. Generally, surprise is determined by side, but one or more individuals from either side may be Aware, while
others are Surprised. Determining Surprise may call for a contest; Notice overcoming Stealth, in some circumstances. If
nothing occurs that grants the other side awareness, Surprise may continue in subsequent Exchanges. When one or more
character achieves Surprise, those without surprise are considered Surprised.

<!-- TOC --><a name="turn-order"></a>

## Turn Order

In Pilot Wave, Aware characters may act in an Exchange. If opposing characters are Aware, or if neither side is
Surprised, side order is determined by an opposed Tactics skill roll. Each side may add a modifier from their Tactics
pool. The side with the higher roll chooses which side acts first in each Exchange. One character acts for the first
side, then one for the second side. This continues until each Aware character has acted in the exchange. If one side has
more aware characters than the other, the extra characters all act after the opposing side is out of characters. Which
character acts in what side turn order is determined by the players for PCs or the GM for NPCs. Once each Aware
character on each side has taken a turn, the next Exchange Begins. Exchanges continue until one of the sides concedes or
is taken out.

<!-- TOC --><a name="action"></a>

### Action

On your turn, take an action and resolve it. Generally, only one substantial action may be taken per turn. Substantial
actions are Creating an Advantage, move, attack, or interactive skills. A move action may be combined with an attack
action. Drawing weapons, reloading, opening a hatch, voice interaction, duck, get up and reactive skills are usually
considered insignificant and can be combined with an action on your turn.

<!-- TOC --><a name="counter"></a>

### Counter

Each action may be countered, once per side, by any who are Aware and have not acted. A counter is not guaranteed, but
always uses that character's action. A counter is a contest. To counter, a character must overcome an opponent's Tactics
skill roll. On success, resolve the countering action before the countered action, unless the other side chooses to
counter. The countering character uses their Tactics skill, although roving Tactics points may be added to the roll.
Potentially, the first action by one side may be countered by the other side, and in turn, that action may be countered
by the first side. By the time the first character takes their turn in an Exchange, it could be the third turn.


<!-- TOC --><a name="scale"></a>

### Scale

Scale determines the size of each hex on the map and the duration of each exchange. A combatant may move any number of
hexes, up to its speed. Moving five or more hexes imposes a Poor (-1) shift on all actions by the combatant, and any
actions against that combatant. Moving ten or more hexes imposes a Terrible (-2) shift and more than 20, Awful (-3). If
both an attacker and a target are moving, the higher shift applies, unless the attacker can match vectors with the
target.

<!-- TOC --><a name="personal-and-vehicle-combat-scale"></a>

#### Personal and Vehicle Combat Scale

| Indoor                 | Outdoor               | Distant               | Far                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 1.5 meter, six seconds | 15 meter, six seconds | 150 meter, one minute | 1.5 km, ten minutes |

For Personal combat, Indoor trotting speed is 10 hexes and running speed is 20 hexes. In Outdoor, Distant and Far
scales, these are divided by 10.

Vehicles are rated in kph and move their kph translates directly to hex speed at Indoor scale. For Outdoor, Distant and
Far, they move their kph/10 in hex speed.

<!-- TOC --><a name="spaceship-combat-scale"></a>

#### Spaceship Combat Scale

| Close Orbit       | Far Orbit          | Extreme Orbit     |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 15 km, one minute | 15kkm, ten minutes | 15Mkm, four hours |

For space combat, a ship may change its speed by up to its maneuver drive value. For example, if stationary, a ship with
an M5 rated maneuver drive can move up to five hexes. In the next exchange, the ship can move up to five hexes plus the
number of hexes it traveled in the last exchange. If this ship was stationary and moved its maximum speed, it could move
five hexes in the first exchange, 10 hexes in the next, 15 hexes in the next and so on.

<!-- TOC --><a name="movement"></a>

### Movement

Pilot Wave uses a grid for personal, vehicle and space combat. In personal combat, one square is 1.5 meters, in vehicle
combat, 15 meters feet and in space combat, 15km. Other scales may be used, depending on the situation.

If movement is combined with another action, that action receives one or more shifts.

<!-- TOC --><a name="personal-combat"></a>

## Personal Combat

Personal combat uses 1.5 meter hexes and 6 second exchanges. Walking speed is 5 hexes and any skill or attack suffers a
Poor  (-1) shift. Trotting speed is 10 hexes and imposes a Terrible (-2) shift. Running speed is 20 hexes +/- Physique
and imposes an Awful (-3) shift. The shift applies to actions by you, or against you, if Countered.
<!-- TOC --><a name="close-combat-1"></a>

### Close Combat

In Pilot Wave, a hand-to-hand attack is against an opposed Close Combat skill roll and generally requires opponents to
be in adjacent hexes. Undefended Close Combat is effortless.

<!-- TOC --><a name="ranged-attacks"></a>

### Ranged Attacks

In Pilot Wave, opponent’s do not roll an opposed skill roll. Instead, difficulty is determined by range.

<!-- TOC --><a name="weapon-and-armor-ratings"></a>

### [Weapon and Armor Ratings](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/more-examples-extras#weapon-and-armor-ratings)

Expanding on More Examples of Extras, the weapon rating adds to the shift value of a successful hit and armor ratings
correspondingly reduce the shifts of a successful hit.

Weapon ranges are categorized as **Close, Point Blank, Effective and Long**. Range is determined by Weapon Type. Range
increases difficulty and reduces damage shifts. Range is in meters/ hexes.

Note, in a vacuum, range still increases difficulty, but it does not reduce damage. Also note, propellants and primers
do not require air for combustion. A weapon without a flat zero compensation will always overshoot in a vacuum. Any
weapon with recoil will propel the shooter in the opposite direction unless anchored.

<!-- TOC --><a name="weapon-ranges-and-ratings"></a>

#### Weapon Ranges and Ratings

| Range            | Close        | Point Blank | Effective     | Long          | Damage Shift |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Range Difficulty | Trivial (0)  | Normal (1)  | Routine (2)   | Difficult (3) |              |
| Damage Shift     | Mediocre (0) | Poor (-1)   | Terrible (-2) | Awful (-3)    |              |  
| Personal         | Adjacent     | \-          | \-            | \-            | Mediocre (0) |
| Archaic          | 1            | 2           | \-            | \-            | Average (1)  |
| Pistol           | 1            | 2           | 3             | \-            | Average (1)  |
| Carbine          | 2            | 3           | 4             | 5             | Fair (2)     |
| Rifle            | 2            | 3           | 4             | 6             | Good (3)     |
| Heavy Weapons    | 2            | 3           | 4             | 5             | Good (3)     |
| High Energy      | 2            | 3           | 5             | 7             | Great (4)    |

_Personal range attacks have a value of Average (1) with a weapon. Rifles, Heavy Weapons and High Energy Weapons are
Normal (1) at Close range and Trivial (0) at Point Blank. Heavy Weapons are hazardous and target all within a zone.
Automatic fire shifts the range difficulty and the weapon value by one._

A Weapon value adds to the shift value of a successful hit. If a weapon has a damage shift of 2, it means that any hit
is worth 2 more shifts than it would normally be. This counts for ties, so when you’re using a weapon, you inflict
stress on a tie instead of getting a boost. That makes weapons very dangerous.

<!-- TOC --><a name="armor-ratings"></a>

#### Armor Ratings

| Armor           | Shifts      |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Ballistic, EVA  | Average (1) |
| Inertial, HEV   | Fair (2)    | 
| Composite Plate | Good (3)    |
| Powered Armor   | Great (4)   |

An Armor value reduces the shifts of a successful hit. So, Armor:2 makes any hit worth 2 less than usual.** If you hit,
but the target’s Armor reduces the shift value to 0 or below, you get a boost to use on your target but don’t do any
harm.**

For example, if a character with a Good (+2) Gun Combat skill shoots an MP-7 (carbine) at a character wearing a Hostile
Environment Vacuum suit (HEV) and rolls 0, +2 for Gun Combat, at close range, Difficulty Trivial (0), that’s a
success (+2). The damage would be 3 (success +2, rifle Good (+3), 5 shifts, and the suit has a damage shift of Fair (2),
reducing that to +3). The target character would take 3 physical stress, or 1 physical stress and a mild consequence.

<!-- TOC --><a name="vehicle-combat-1"></a>

## Vehicle Combat

Vehicle combat uses 15 meter hexes and 6 second exchanges or 150 meter hexes and 60 second exchanges, depending on the
scale.

<!-- TOC --><a name="spaceship-combat"></a>

## Spaceship Combat

Spaceship combat uses different ranges, depending on what we're trying to represent. Close and Visual range use 15km
hexes with one minute exchanges. Far range uses 15,000 km hexes with 10 minute exchanges. Extreme range uses 15,000,000
km hexes and exchanges are arbitrary. System range, not typically used for combat, uses the same size hexes, but they
are expressed in AU, such that one hex is approximately 0.10 AU.

CPR/EPR is only effective at Close range (adjacent at Visual range), as it takes about eight exchanges to travel one
hex. At far range, CPR/EPR takes about 7.5 hours to travel one hex. If the target was stationary or drifting, CPR/EPR
would eventually hit.

Missiles are effective at Close, Visual and Far range, hitting on the same exchange as when fired, as they travel at a
constant acceleration of up to 340G, more than 30 hexes at Far range. At Close range, they are hazardous.

At extreme range, missiles travel about one hex every thirty minutes, although that continues to accelerate.

In an exchange, turn order is determined the same as in personal combat, with modifiers from maneuver drive and tactics
considered. Each side has a turn in each phase, with multiples all acting together. Groups of the same ship type may be
handled as a unit.

Spaceship combat ranges are categorized as **Close, Visual, Far and Extreme**. Range is determined by Weapon Type. Range
increases difficulty. Range is in zones.

| Range            | Close       | Visual     | Far         | Extreme       | Damage Shift |
|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Range Difficulty | Trivial (0) | Normal (1) | Routine (2) | Difficult (3) |              |
| CPR/ EPR         | Adjacent    | \-         | \-          | \-            | Average (1)  |
| Missiles         | \-          | 2          | 3           | \-            | Fair (2)     |
| KEW              | \-          | 2          | \-          | \-            | Good (3)     |
| DEW              | \-          | 3          | 4           | \-            | Great (4)    |

<!-- TOC --><a name="phases"></a>

### Phases

- **Sensors Phase:** This phase involves gathering information about the surrounding environment, detecting enemy ships,
  and assessing their positions, velocities, and other relevant data. It sets the stage for subsequent actions such as
  movement and targeting.
- **Movement Phase:** During this phase, ships maneuver through space, adjusting their positions, velocities, and
  trajectories based on sensor data and tactical considerations. Movement decisions may include evasive maneuvers,
  pursuit, interception, or repositioning for a better firing angle.
- **Targeting Phase:** In this phase, ships select their targets and aim their weapons systems, targeting drives,
  weapons, sensors, command and control (crew) and hull. Targeting may involve locking onto enemy ships, calculating
  firing solutions, and preparing to unleash weapons fire.
- **Countermeasures Phase:** Ships deploy defensive measures to evade or mitigate enemy attacks, such as point defense,
  jamming enemy sensors, deploying decoys, or performing evasive maneuvers. Countermeasures are crucial for enhancing
  survivability and minimizing damage.
- **Resolution:** Damage is resolved after countermeasures.
- **Boarding/EVA Phase:** At close range, ships may engage in boarding actions or extravehicular activities (EVA), such
  as launching boarding parties, deploying assault shuttles, or conducting repairs and maintenance on the exterior of
  the ship. Boarding actions can lead to intense close-quarters combat and potentially decisive outcomes.

<!-- TOC --><a name="sensors"></a>

#### Sensors

A ship signals if it's using maneuver drive, weapons or active sensors. Drift is the absence of drives, weapons or
active sensors. Passive sensors retain drift.

|         | Active vs Signal | Passive vs Signal | Active vs Drift | Passive vs Drift |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Close   | Certain          | Effortless        | Trivial         | Routine          |
| Visual  | Effortless       | Trivial           | Routine         | Formidable       |
| Far     | Trivial          | Routine           | Formidable      | Impossible       |
| Extreme | Routine          | Formidable        | Impossible      | Futile           |
