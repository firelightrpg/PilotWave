# _Pilot Wave_

_A Science Fiction RPG based on [Fudge](https://fudgesrd.opengamingnetwork.com/)/[Fate](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/)_

# The Fudge/ Fate Ladder

For conflict resolution, Pilot Wave uses an expanded [ladder](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/taking-action-dice-ladder#the-ladder) of adjectives and numbers to rate the attempt, the dice results plus modifiers against the difficulty, either a passive difficulty, set by the game master, or an active opposition, the opponent’s dice results plus modifiers. Roll [four fudge dice](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/taking-action-dice-ladder) (4DF) and add the result to the skill rating to get the final attempt.

# Pilot Wave Character Creation

# Pilot Wave Aspects

Each player character starts with five aspects, chosen from an archetype, including one or more careers, trouble aspects, convictions and ties. A player character also gets to choose three stunts, assign attributes and assign skills, one Great (+4), two Good (+3), three Fair (+2) and four Average (+1). 

## Archetype

Your archetype is your character’s [High Concept](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/your-character-idea#high-concept). Your high concept is a phrase that sums up what your character is about. Here’s a list of [example high concepts](https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Aspects_List#Archetypes_.2F_High_Concepts).

## Career(s)

Each player character has a former career, or careers. These can be any manner of schooling or job training that result in the set of skills and other aspects, aligning with the Archetype. Typically, most characters will only have one career, but may have a career focus, or a significant shift in careers. Common careers include military, exploratory, academic, law enforcement or agent, trader, extralegal or ship crew. Employers may be government, corporate or private. You may wish to select your skill set first, then add a career justifying those choices, or the other way around. [Sample careers](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Vocation)

## [Trouble](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/your-character-idea#trouble)

Every character has a troublesome aspect that’s part of their story.

## Convictions

Choose two convictions that guide your character’s decisions and role play. Here’s some [examples of convictions](https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Aspects_List#Beliefs.2C_Convictions_.26_Mottos).

## Ties

Choose two ties that inform your character’s patrons. These can be friend or foe, but define aspects of your character. 

## Gear

Choose one gear aspect, a military grade weapon or armor, a high tech level sensor, sensory implants, battlefield computer, gravity belt, high tech medical scanner, high tech environment suit, combat drugs, truth drugs, energy weapon, etc. 

# [Stunts](https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/stunts)

Each player character gets three stunts. Stunts may be aspected, triggered, broad or combined. [Examples](http://evilhat.wikidot.com/fate-core-stunts).

# [Attributes](https://fudgesrd.opengamingnetwork.com/fudgesrd/character-creation/character-creation-terms/)

Attributes in Pilot Wave help define the raw nature of the character, and serve as a catch-all when a challenge does not represent training. Player characters have 3 shifts to distribute as desired for attributes.

## Physique

Physique represents your physical strength, agility and stamina. Your physique determines the amount of physical stress you can take. See Fate [Physique](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/physique).

## Psyche

Psyche represents your force of personality, serenity, presence and willpower. Retrying failed tasks often requires a determination skill roll, and psyche is the relevant skill. Staying cool during a firefight or other hazard may require a poise skill roll, and psyche is the relevant skill. Psyche determines the amount of mental stress you can take. Substitutes for Fate [Will](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/will).

# [Skills](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/skills#pick-and-rate-your-characters-skills)

Skills in Pilot Wave comprise the following categories. Each category is not a skill, per se, rather a range of skills. Subjacent skill rolls can be made at a Poor (-1) shift. Terrible (-2) is the default for any skill you do not have, unless otherwise noted.

* Overcome: Use medical to overcome any obstacle related to illness or injury. Shifts translate to clearing physical stress, or wounds, provided you have access to a med bay.
* Create an Advantage: Use medical to create advantages based on your understanding of anatomy and biology.

## Notice

Notice represents your senses of observation, awareness of your surroundings and training to identify obscured or camouflaged targets. See Fate [Notice](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/notice).

## Tactics

Tactics represents training in combat tactics, leadership and reconnaissance. Each side in a conflict has a Tactics pool, the total of all Tactics skill points for each character. At the beginning of a conflict, each side may subtract a number for their Tactics pool and apply it to their Tactics roll to determine side order. The remaining Tactics points serve as one or more roving die modifiers, reset on each exchange. Attempting to counter an enemy's action is a contest, where you attempt to overcome your opponent’s Tactics skill roll.

* Overcome: Use Tactics to overcome any obstacle related to enemy positions, movements or strength. 
* Create an Advantage: Use Tactics to create advantages based on your understanding of combat tactics, building defenses or choosing the best locations for combat advantage.
* Attack: You may use Tactics directly for attacking, and it affects exchange order and counters.
* Defense: You may use your Tactics skill directly for defense, but you may create advantages based on your knowledge of defensible positions.

When you use a roving die modifier, subtract it from your tactics pool for that exchange. At the start of each exchange, your tactics pool resets, minus the amount you used for determining side order. You may add a roving die modifier from your side’s Tactics pool after the roll, but before knowing the outcome. 

## Vehicle Combat

Vehicle combat represents training in sensor ops and gunnery with ground, water and airspace vehicles. Substitutes for Fate [Shoot](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/shoot). Subjacent skills are Space Combat.

## Vehicle Ops

Vehicle ops represents training in pilot and navigation, specifically with ground, water and airspace vehicles. Subjacent skills are Space Ops.

## Zero-G

Zero-G represents training in the operation of vacuum suits, airlocks, zero-g environments, recoil and inertia.

* Overcome: Use Zero-G to overcome any obstacle related to Zero-G environments and equipment. 
* Create an Advantage: Use Zero-G to create advantages based on your understanding of Zero-G environments and equipment. The shift from acceleration induced gravity to Zero-G and vice versa can be very disorienting, especially for those untrained in Zero-G.

# Psychic Powers

Psychic abilities are powers, not generally available to the public. Several secret organizations exist that research and experiment on children, awakening various psychic phenomena. Psychic abilities are not generally innate, nor acquired by training, outside of these experiments. Few survive the experiments, but those that do are highly valued and feared. Once a person reaches adulthood without training, psychic abilities are no longer available. For unknown reasons, only one power manifests in any psychic individual and power level is generally low, but sometimes spikes with emotions. Manifesting a power can be used to overcome an obstacle, create an advantage, and some to attack or defend.

### Enhancements

Psychic powers usually allow you to do something extraordinary, or in the simplest case, add a boost to an appropriate skill check to overcome an obstacle. 

## Jumper

Jumpers are able to teleport within a zone at will. Extreme focus or emotions can allow them to jump further, even miles, but at a risk. Not all jumpers survive longer jumps...

## Mover

Movers are telekinetics able to move small items they can see within a zone at will. Extreme focus or emotions can allow a mover to move larger objects or even ward off physical attacks by erecting a telekinetic shield.

## Pusher

Pushers are telepaths that can push thoughts into another subject, who seemingly act as if they are their own. They are some of the most feared psychics, as even a simple thought can lead to fatal actions or betrayal of allies. Some can read thoughts, yankers, and may cause their targets to betray their secrets. Some have even been known as wipers, able to erase memories...

## Shifter

Shifters are able to manifest photokinetic powers, creating a mirage, hiding objects or people in plain sight, or passing off objects as something else, like a winning poker hand for a poor one. Shifters can also disrupt or blank psychic power, able to prevent others from using their powers or shadow those with psychic abilities from Sniffs.

## Sniff

Sniffs are clairvoyants able to see images or scenes in real time, two to three zones away. Sniffs can also detect other nearby psychics when they use their power.

## Watcher

Watchers are precogs that can see images or scenes from the future. The future is not fixed, so this can be a very confusing and mentally disturbing ability. Near now events are much clearer and with focus, can provide seemingly supernatural defensive advantages. 

# [Resolving Attacks](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/resolving-attacks)

Fill in one stress box greater than or equal to the value of an attack, take one or more consequences, or fill in one stress box and take consequences—if you can’t do one of these three things, you’re **taken out**.

# [Consequences](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/resolving-attacks#consequences)

* Mild: –2 to attack value
* Moderate: –4 to attack value
* Severe: –6 to attack value
* Extreme: –8 to attack and permanent character aspect

# [Recover](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/resolving-attacks#recovering-from-a-consequence)

* Mild: overcome Fair (+2), one whole scene
* Moderate: overcome Great (+4), one whole session
* Severe: overcome Fantastic (+6), one whole scenario

# [Aspect Types](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/aspects-fate-points)

* Game aspects: permanent, made during game creation
* Character aspects: permanent, made during character creation
* Situation aspects: last for a scene, until overcome, or until irrelevant
* Boosts: last until invoked one time
* Consequences: last until recovered

# [Invoking Aspects](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/invoking-compelling-aspects#invoking-aspects)

Spend a fate point or free invoke. Choose one:

* +2 to your skill roll
* Reroll all your dice
* Teamwork: +2 to another character’s roll versus relevant passive opposition
* Obstacle: +2 to the passive opposition

Free invokes stack with a paid one and each other.

# [Compelling Aspects](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/invoking-compelling-aspects#compelling-aspects)

Accept a complication for a fate point.

* Event-based: You have ____ aspect and are in ____ situation, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, ____ would happen to you. Damn your luck.
* Decision-based: You have ____ aspect in ____ situation, so it makes sense that you’d decide to ____. This goes wrong when ____ happens.

# [Refresh](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/fate-point-economy)

At the start of a new session, you reset your fate points to your refresh rate. If you ended the last session with more points, you keep the extra. At the end of a scenario, you reset to your refresh rate no matter what. 

# [Spending Fate Points](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/fate-point-economy)

Spend fate points to:

* Invoke an aspect
* Power a stunt
* Refuse a compel
* Declare a story detail

# [Challenges](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/challenges)

* Each obstacle or goal that requires a different skill gets an overcome roll.
* Interpret failure, costs, and success of each roll together to determine final outcome.

# [Contests](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/contests)

* Contesting characters roll appropriate skills.
* If you got the highest result, you score a victory.
* If you succeed with style and no one else does, then you get two victories.
* If there’s a tie for the highest result, no one gets a victory, and an unexpected twist occurs.
* The first participant to achieve three victories wins the contest.

# [Conflicts](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/conflicts)

* Set the scene, describing the environment the conflict takes place in, creating situation aspects and zones, and establishing who’s participating and what side they’re on.
* Determine the turn order.
* Start the first exchange:
    * On your turn, take an action and then resolve it.
    * On other people’s turns, defend or respond to their actions as necessary.
    * At the end of everyone’s turn, start again with a new exchange.
* Conflict is over when everyone on one side has conceded or been taken out.

## Surprise

In Pilot Wave, at the beginning of a conflict, Surprise is determined by invoking a Situation Aspect or a Character Aspect. Generally, surprise is determined by side, but one or more individuals from either side may be Aware, while others are Surprised. Determining Surprise may call for a contest; Notice overcoming Stealth, in some circumstances. If nothing occurs that grants the other side awareness, Surprise may continue in subsequent Exchanges. When one or more character achieves Surprise, those without surprise are considered Surprised.

## Turn Order

In Pilot Wave, Aware characters may act in an Exchange. If opposing characters are Aware, or if neither side is Surprised, side order is determined by an opposed Tactics skill roll. Each side may add a modifier from their Tactics pool. The side with the higher roll chooses which side acts first in each Exchange. One character acts for the first side, then one for the second side. This continues until each Aware character has acted in the exchange. If one side has more aware characters than the other, the extra characters all act after the opposing side is out of characters. Which character acts in what side turn order is determined by the players for PCs or the GM for NPCs. Once each Aware character on each side has taken a turn, the next Exchange Begins. Exchanges continue until one of the sides concedes or is taken out.

### Action

On your turn, take an action and resolve it. Generally, only one substantial action may be taken per turn. Substantial actions are Creating an Advantage, move, attack, or interactive skills. A move action may be combined with an attack action. Drawing weapons, reloading, opening a hatch, voice interaction, duck, get up and reactive skills are usually considered insignificant and can be combined with an action on your turn. 

### Counter

Each action may be countered, once per side, by any who are Aware and have not acted. A counter is not guaranteed, but always uses that character's action. A counter is a contest. To counter, a character must overcome an opponent's Tactics skill roll. On success, resolve the countering action before the countered action, unless the other side chooses to counter. The countering character uses their Tactics skill, although roving Tactics points may be added to the roll. Potentially, the first action by one side may be countered by the other side, and in turn, that action may be countered by the first side. By the time the first character takes their turn in an Exchange, it could be the third turn.

### Movement

Pilot Wave uses a grid for personal, vehicle and space combat. In personal combat, one square is 5 feet, in vehicle combat, 50 feet and in space combat, 1000 miles. Other scales may be used, depending on the situation. 

In personal combat, if movement is combined with another action, that action receives one or more shifts. Walking speed is 5 squares and any skill or attack suffers a Poor (-1) shift. Trotting speed is 10 squares and imposes a Terrible (-2) shift. Running speed is 20 squares +/- Physique and imposes an Awful (-3) shift. The shift applies to actions by you, or against you, if Countered. 

## Close Combat

In Pilot Wave, a hand-to-hand attack is against an opposed Close Combat skill roll and generally requires opponents to be in adjacent squares. Undefended Close Combat is effortless. 

## Ranged Attacks

In Pilot Wave, opponent’s do not roll an opposed skill roll. Instead, difficulty is determined by range. 

### [Weapon and Armor Ratings](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/more-examples-extras#weapon-and-armor-ratings)

Expanding on More Examples of Extras, the weapon rating adds to the shift value of a successful hit and armor ratings correspondingly reduce the shifts of a successful hit. 

Weapon ranges are categorized as **Close, Point Blank, Effective and Long**. Range is determined by Weapon Type. Range increases difficulty and reduces damage shifts. Range is in zones.

#### Weapon Ranges and Ratings 							Armor Ratings
| Range            | Close        | Point Blank | Effective     | Long          | Damage Shift |    | Armor           | Shifts      |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|----|-----------------|-------------|
| Range Difficulty | Trivial (0)  | Normal (1)  | Routine (2)   | Difficult (3) |              |    | Ballistic, EVA  | Average (1) |
| Attack Shift     | Mediocre (0) | Poor (-1)   | Terrible (-2) | Awful (-3)    |              |    | Inertial, HEV   | Fair (2)    |   
| Personal         | Adjacent     | \-          | \-            | \-            | Mediocre (0) |    | Composite Plate | Good (3)    |
| Archaic          | 1            | 2           | 3             | 4             | Average (1)  |    | Powered Armor   | Great (4)   |
| Pistol           | 1            | 2           | 3             | 4             | Average (1)  |                 
| Carbine          | 2            | 3           | 4             | 5             | Fair (2)     |
| Rifle            | 2            | 3           | 4             | 6             | Good (3)     |
| Heavy Weapons    | 2            | 3           | 4             | 5             | Good (3)     |
| High Energy      | 2            | 3           | 5             | 7             | Great (4)    |

_Personal range attacks have a value of Average (1) with a weapon. Rifles, Heavy Weapons and High Energy Weapons are Normal (1) at Close range and Trivial (0) at Point Blank. Heavy Weapons are hazardous and target all within a zone. Automatic fire shifts the range difficulty and the weapon value by one._

A Weapon value adds to the shift value of a successful hit. So, if you have Weapon:2, it means that any hit is worth 2 more shifts than it would normally be. This counts for ties, so when you’re using a weapon, you inflict stress on a tie instead of getting a boost. That makes weapons very dangerous.

An Armor value reduces the shifts of a successful hit. So, Armor:2 makes any hit worth 2 less than usual.** If you hit, but the target’s Armor reduces the shift value to 0 or below, you get a boost to use on your target but don’t do any harm.**

For example, if a character with a Good (+2) Gun Combat skill shoots an MP-7 (carbine) at a character wearing a Hostile Environment Vacuum suit (HEV) and rolls 0, +2 for Gun Combat, at close range (Difficulty Trivial (0)), that’s a success (+2). The damage would be 3 (success +2, rifle Good (+3), 5 shifts, and the suit has a damage shift of Fair (2), reducing that to +3). The target character would take 3 physical stress, or 1 physical stress and a mild consequence.
