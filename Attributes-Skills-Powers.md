# [Attributes](https://fudgesrd.opengamingnetwork.com/fudgesrd/character-creation/character-creation-terms/)

Attributes in Pilot Wave help define the raw nature of the character, and serve as a catch-all when a challenge does not
represent training. Player characters have 3 shifts to distribute as desired for attributes.

## Physique

Physique represents your physical strength, agility and stamina. Your physique determines the amount of physical stress
you can take. See Fate [Physique](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/physique).

## Psyche

Psyche represents your force of personality, serenity, presence and willpower. Retrying failed tasks often requires a
determination skill roll, and psyche is the relevant skill. Staying cool during a firefight or other hazard may require
a poise skill roll, and psyche is the relevant skill. Psyche determines the amount of mental stress you can take.

## Tactics

Tactics represents training in combat tactics, leadership and reconnaissance. Each side in a conflict has a Tactics
pool, the total of all Tactics skill points for each character. At the beginning of a conflict, each side may subtract a
number for their Tactics pool and apply it to their Tactics roll to determine side order. The remaining Tactics points
serve as one or more roving die modifiers, reset on each exchange. Attempting to counter an enemy's action is a contest,
where you attempt to overcome your opponent’s Tactics skill roll.

* Overcome: Use Tactics to overcome any obstacle related to enemy positions, movements or strength.
* Create an Advantage: Use Tactics to create advantages based on your understanding of combat tactics, building defenses
  or choosing the best locations for combat advantage.
* Attack: You may use Tactics directly for attacking, and it affects exchange order and counters.
* Defense: You may use your Tactics skill directly for defense, but you may create advantages based on your knowledge of
  defensible positions.

When you use a roving die modifier, subtract it from your tactics pool for that exchange. At the start of each exchange,
your tactics pool resets, minus the amount you used for determining side order. You may add a roving die modifier from
your side’s Tactics pool after the roll, but before knowing the outcome.

* Overcome: Use Zero-G to overcome any obstacle related to Zero-G environments and equipment.
* Create an Advantage: Use Zero-G to create advantages based on your understanding of Zero-G environments and equipment.
  The shift from acceleration induced gravity to Zero-G and vice versa can be very disorienting, especially for those
  untrained in Zero-G.

# Psychic Powers

Psychic abilities are powers, not generally available to the public. Several secret organizations exist that research
and experiment on children, awakening various psychic phenomena. Psychic abilities are not generally innate, nor
acquired by training, outside of these experiments. Few survive the experiments, but those that do are highly valued and
feared. Once a person reaches adulthood without training, psychic abilities are no longer available. For unknown
reasons, only one power manifests in any psychic individual and power level is generally low, but sometimes spikes with
emotions. Manifesting a power can be used to overcome an obstacle, create an advantage, and some to attack or defend.

### Enhancements

Psychic powers usually allow you to do something extraordinary, or in the simplest case, add a boost to an appropriate
skill check to overcome an obstacle.

## Jumper

Jumpers are able to teleport within a zone at will. Extreme focus or emotions can allow them to jump further, even
miles, but at a risk. Not all jumpers survive longer jumps...

## Mover

Movers are telekinetics able to move small items they can see within a zone at will. Extreme focus or emotions can allow
a mover to move larger objects or even ward off physical attacks by erecting a telekinetic shield.

## Pusher

Pushers are telepaths that can push thoughts into another subject, who seemingly act as if they are their own. They are
some of the most feared psychics, as even a simple thought can lead to fatal actions or betrayal of allies. Some can
read thoughts, yankers, and may cause their targets to betray their secrets. Some have even been known as wipers, able
to erase memories...

## Shifter

Shifters are able to manifest photokinetic powers, creating a mirage, hiding objects or people in plain sight, or
passing off objects as something else, like a winning poker hand for a poor one. Shifters can also disrupt or blank
psychic power, able to prevent others from using their powers or shadow those with psychic abilities from Sniffs.

## Sniff

Sniffs are clairvoyants able to see images or scenes in real time, two to three zones away. Sniffs can also detect other
nearby psychics when they use their power.

## Watcher

Watchers are precogs that can see images or scenes from the future. The future is not fixed, so this can be a very
confusing and mentally disturbing ability. Near now events are much clearer and with focus, can provide seemingly
supernatural defensive advantages.
