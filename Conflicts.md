## Surprise

In Pilot Wave, at the beginning of a conflict, Surprise is determined by invoking a Situation Aspect or a Character
Aspect. Generally, surprise is determined by side, but one or more individuals from either side may be Aware, while
others are Surprised. Determining Surprise may call for a contest; Notice overcoming Stealth, in some circumstances. In
Far Vehicle or Starship combat, surprise is usually determined by successful sensor ops. If nothing occurs that grants
the other side awareness, Surprise may continue in subsequent Exchanges. When one or more characters are Surprised,
those
who aren't surprised are considered Aware.

## Turn Order

In Pilot Wave, Aware characters may act in an Exchange. If opposing characters are Aware, or if neither side is
Surprised, side order is determined by an opposed Tactics skill roll. Each side may add a modifier from their Tactics
pool. The side with the higher roll chooses which side acts first in each Exchange. One character acts for the first
side, then one for the second side. This continues until each Aware character has acted in the exchange. If one side has
more aware characters than the other, the extra characters all act after the opposing side is out of characters. Which
character acts in what side turn order is determined by the players for PCs or the GM for NPCs. Once each Aware
character on each side has taken a turn, the next Exchange Begins. Exchanges continue until one of the sides concedes or
is taken out.

## Action

> On your turn, take an action and resolve it.

Generally, only one substantial action may be taken per turn. Substantial
actions are Creating an Advantage, move, attack, or interactive skills. A move action may be combined with an attack
action. Drawing weapons, reloading, opening a hatch, voice interaction, duck, get up and reactive skills are usually
considered insignificant and can be combined with an action on your turn.

## Counter

Each action may be countered, once per side, by any who are Aware and have not acted. A counter is not guaranteed, but
always uses that character's action. A counter is a contest. To counter, a character must overcome an opponent's Tactics
skill roll. On success, resolve the countering action before the countered action, unless the other side chooses to
counter. The countering character uses their Tactics skill, although roving Tactics points may be added to the roll.
Potentially, the first action by one side may be countered by the other side, and in turn, that action may be countered
by the first side. By the time the first character takes their turn in the first Exchange, it could be the third turn.

## Movement

Pilot Wave does not use zones, but instead uses a hex grid for combat.

## Scale

Scale determines the size of each hex on the map and the duration of each exchange.

## Personal and Vehicle Scale

|                       | Close       | Short       | Medium     | Long        |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Hex Size**          | 1.5 meter   | 15 meter    | 150 meter  | 1.5 km      |
| **Exchange Duration** | six seconds | six seconds | one minute | ten minutes |

### Personal Combat

For Personal combat, up to ten hexes is walking speed and up to 20 +/- Physique, running speed. In Short, Medium and
Long scales, these are divided by 10.

### Vehicle Combat

Vehicles are rated in kph and their kph translates directly to hex speed at Close scale. For Short, Medium and Long
scales, kph/10 equals hex speed.

## Spaceship Scale

|                       | Near        | Close Orbit | Far Orbit   | Extreme |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Hex Size**          | 15 km       | 1500 km     | 15 Kkm      | 15 Mkm  |
| **Exchange Duration** | six seconds | ten minutes | 100 minutes | 1 day   | 

A combatant may move any number of hexes, up to its speed. Moving less than ten hexes imposes a Poor (-1) shift on all
actions by the combatant, and any actions against that combatant. Moving ten or more hexes imposes a Terrible (-2)
shift and 20 or more, Awful (-3). If both an attacker and a target are moving, shifts are cumulative if traveling in
opposite directions. The difference in shifts applies, if moving in the same direction. Matching vectors is the same as
both attacker and target being stationary.

### Space combat

Space combat uses Near, Close Orbit, Far Orbit or Extreme scale. Visual range is three or less hexes at Near scale.

A ship may change its speed by up to its maneuver drive value.

_For example, if stationary, a ship with an M5 rated maneuver drive can move up to five hexes. In the next exchange,
the ship can move up to five hexes plus the number of hexes it traveled in the last exchange. If this ship was
stationary and moved its maximum speed, it could move five hexes in the first exchange, 10 hexes in the next, 15
hexes in the next and so on._

_**Exposure to greater than 6Gs for more than a few moments causes issues with vision, blood pressure, spinal stress,
nausea and headache. After which, you must overcome a difficult (-3), [Space Ops] skill roll or take a physical hit
equal to the shifts you failed by.**_

_**One minute of exposure to higher than 6Gs takes you out. Ten minutes or more leads to death.**_

## Personal Combat

Personal combat may use **Close, Short, Medium or Long** scales.

### Hand-to-Hand Combat

In Pilot Wave, a hand-to-hand attack is against an opposed Close Combat skill roll and generally requires opponents to
be in adjacent hexes. Undefended Close Combat is effortless.

### Ranged Combat

In Pilot Wave, opponent’s do not roll an opposed skill roll. Instead, difficulty is determined by range band.

### [Weapon and Armor Ratings](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/more-examples-extras#weapon-and-armor-ratings)

> A Weapon value adds to the shift value of a successful hit. So, if you have Weapon:2, it means that any hit is worth 2
> more shifts than it would normally be. This counts for ties, so when you’re using a weapon, you inflict stress on a
> tie
> instead of getting a boost. That makes weapons very dangerous.
>
> An Armor value reduces the shifts of a successful hit. So, Armor:2 makes any hit worth 2 less than usual. **If you
> hit, but the target’s Armor reduces the shift value to 0 or below, you get a boost to use on your target but don’t do
> any harm.**

> > _For example, if a character with a Good (+2) Gun Combat skill shoots an MP-7 (carbine) at a character wearing a
> > Hostile Environment Vacuum suit (HEV) and rolls 0, +2 for Gun Combat, at Close Quarters range band (15 meters or
> > less), Difficulty Trivial (0), that’s a success (+2)._
>
> > _The damage would be 3 (success +2, rifle Good (+3), a 5-shift-hit, and the suit has a damage shift of
> > Fair (2), reducing that to +3). The target character would take 3 physical stress, or 1 physical stress and a mild
> > consequence._

### Range Bands

Weapon ranges are categorized in range bands of  **Close Quarters, Point Blank, Effective and Maximum**. Range band
distances are determined by Weapon Type and are distinct from scale, which is the same for all weapons. Range bands
increase difficulty and reduce damage shifts.

- Close Quarters: Aiming can be in the general direction, but aiming is unwieldy with rifles.
- Point Blank: the distance a weapon can hit a target without compensating for bullet drop
    - Note: in a vacuum, range still increases difficulty, but it does not reduce damage. Also note, propellants and
      primers do not require air for combustion. A weapon without a flat zero compensation will always overshoot in a
      vacuum. Any weapon with recoil will propel the shooter in the opposite direction unless anchored.
- Effective: A weapon's lethal range with compensation for bullet drop.
- Maximum: The maximum range a weapon can reach, but usually without killing power unless the shot placement is perfect.

### Weapon Ranges and Ratings (Short scale)

Distance is in hexes for Close scale. Divide hexes by 10 for Short scale and 100 for Medium scale. At Medium scale and
further, handguns are ineffective. In the rare case personal combat is conducted at Long scale, divide by 1000, meaning
a rifle or directed energy weapon could target an adjacent square, but other weapons would be ineffective.

| Range Band   | Close Quarters |                | Point Blank |                | Effective   |                | Maximum     |                |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Weapon**   | **Squares**    | **Difficulty** | **Squares** | **Difficulty** | **Squares** | **Difficulty** | **Squares** | **Difficulty** |

| Pistol       | 10             | Trivial (0)    | 20          | Normal (1)     | 40          | Routine (2)    | 60          | Difficult (3)  |
| Carbine      | 10             | Trivial (0)    | 100         | Normal (1)     | 200         | Routine (2)    | 500         | Difficult (3)  |
| Rifle        | 10             | Normal (1)     | 200         | Normal (1)     | 400         | Routine (2)    | 1000        | Difficult (3)  |

| Range Band       | Contact      | Point Blank | Effective     | Maximum    |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Damage Shift** | Mediocre (0) | Poor (-1)   | Terrible (-2) | Awful (-3) |  

_Rifle includes any shoulder fired chemically or electronically propelled round or directed energy weapon._

_Hand-to-hand attacks have a value of Average (1) with a weapon like a knife, bayonet, rifle butt, etc._

### Automatic Weapon Fire

Most carbines and some pistols as well as mounted rifles can be set to automatic fire. Switching fire modes is an
action. Automatic fire can target adjacent targets in addition to the primary target or make a second attack when
concentrated on the primary target. Automatic fire increases the attack difficulty by one shift. Automatic fire uses at
least three rounds per target, or six when concentrated on the primary target.

### Blast Weapons

Some weapons such as a plasma gun or a grenade launcher have a blast area. A blast weapon automatically targets adjacent
targets with one less damage shift than the primary target, if the primary target is hit. These weapons are always
hazardous and any miss must determine the point of impact, and the point of impact and any adjacent hexes take the
damage instead.

## Vehicle Combat

Vehicle combat may use **Close, Short, Medium or Long** scales, but Short and Medium are most common. Vehicle weapons
require a mount.

## Spaceship Combat

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starfield-ship-designs.jpg" />
</p>


Spaceship combat uses different scales, depending on what we're trying to represent. Near uses 15km hexes with six
second exchanges. Close Orbit uses 1500 km hexes and ten minute exchanges. Far Orbit uses 15,000 km hexes with 100
minute exchanges. Extreme scale uses 15,000,000 km hexes and exchanges are one day. System range, not typically used for
combat, uses the same size hexes, but they are expressed in AU, such that one hex is approximately 0.10 AU.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.moddb.com/cache/images/mods/1/4/3466/thumb_620x2000/16128.jpg" />
</p>


Chemically and electronically propelled rounds (CPR/EPR) travel at a speed of one hex per exchange. They are typically
only used for point defense unless a target is adjacent and stationary (or vector-matched), though they can also create
hazards, limiting a ship's movement at longer distances. If a target is stationary or drifting, CPR/EPR will eventually
hit. Each turret has a small compensator for recoil.

Missiles travel at a constant acceleration for the first 18 seconds of burn. After which they travel at a constant
velocity. This only matters at Near scale, where they travel like a ship, up to two hexes in the first exchange, up to
four hexes in the second exchange and up to six hexes in subsequent exchanges. At Close Orbit and higher scales, they
travel six hexes at a constant velocity. At this velocity, they retain enough fuel for last minute course correction,
allowing them to turn up to 60 degrees and move one additional hex or up to two additional hexes in the same direction.
Outside of these parameters, missiles always hit their targets.

At any scale, it's important to note the vector of the ship that fires CPR/EPR or missiles. For example, if the
attacking ship was moving at a constant velocity of 4G in the direction of the target, a missile could move six hexes in
the first exchange, eight in the second and ten in the third and subsequent exchanges. If a missile is fired from a
fleeing ship traveling at 4Gs, the missile would actually move in the direction of the fleeing ship two hexes in the
first exchange, then be stationary for the second, and move two hexes back in the third and subsequent exchanges.

</p>

Plasma weapons electronically propel an ionized hydrogen mass at extreme velocities. They can immediately hit targets up
to 10 hexes away, and travel up to 10 hexes per exchange. Plasma weapons use maneuver drive compensation.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgbyQMCS1wqJ3lMlllevKSb9mJnE6jiaqtFmGK1TnVBoC6Dm2mBTLX2Sbt07hX5SYkgvMcapP3rwzSKcPSbTeBrneKpN08IazMwoX0JRP5JgEwDskNqS-AOjAuzoUdL1G_YwJM-qZjyfNn/s1600/MOI_Firing_MAC_Gun.png" />
</p>

Particle accelerators charge and accelerate electrons to near light speed velocities and thus immediately hit targets at
all scales. A massive amount of energy is required to fire and the particles collide, producing recoil. These are
typically spinal mounts with maneuver drive compensation. The target will often be perforated, or moved one hex and its
direction will change to the direction of the blast.

In an exchange, turn order is determined the same as in personal combat. Each side has a turn in each phase, with
multiples all acting together. Each phase may be countered. Groups of the same ship type may be handled as a unit.

Spaceship combat doesn't use range bands as there's no medium in a vacuum. However, the difficulty hitting still
increases with distance. The difficulty is shifted by ship size. Missiles do not roll for attack, as they will always
strike a target that does not have or use point defense or try to outrun them.

Ships around 10 tons are usually shuttles, drop-ships or fighters. Freighters, corvettes, frigates and mid-sized
merchant ships are around 100 tons. Capital ships, carriers, container ships, cruisers and destroyers are 1000 tons or
larger.

### Power

Each ship typically has a power plant, a fuel tank, batteries and solar cells. The power plant can output one power
point per rating per exchange. A ship's power plant must be high enough to generate the jump or maneuver drive rating.
For example, an M6 rated maneuver drive requires a power plant of P6 or higher. To change speed by 6 would deplete the
power plant. Ship's batteries are typically rated the same size as the power plant, and can be used in the same
manner. For example, you could change speed by up to 6 and still fire a plasma cannon with 3 points, fire a missile with
2 points and save 1 point for point defense cannons. The following exchange, your battery would be depleted, but your
power plant would be recharged. Solar cells can also charge batteries, but at a much slower rate, unsuitable for combat.

### Phases

- **Sensors Phase:** This phase involves gathering information about the surrounding environment, detecting enemy ships,
  and assessing their positions, velocities, and other relevant data. It sets the stage for subsequent actions such as
  movement and targeting.
- **Movement Phase:** During this phase, ships maneuver through space, adjusting their positions, velocities, and
  trajectories based on sensor data and tactical considerations. Movement decisions may include evasive maneuvers,
  pursuit, interception, or repositioning for a better firing angle.
- **Targeting Phase:** In this phase, ships select their targets and aim their weapons systems, targeting drives,
  weapons, sensors, command and control (crew) and hull. Targeting may involve locking onto enemy ships, calculating
  firing solutions, and preparing to unleash weapons fire.
- **Countermeasures Phase:** Ships deploy defensive measures to evade or mitigate enemy attacks, such as point defense,
  jamming enemy sensors, deploying decoys, or performing evasive maneuvers. Countermeasures are crucial for enhancing
  survivability and minimizing damage.
- **Resolution:** Damage is resolved after countermeasures.
- **Boarding/EVA Phase:** At close range, ships may engage in boarding actions or extravehicular activities (EVA), such
  as launching boarding parties, deploying assault shuttles, or conducting repairs and maintenance on the exterior of
  the ship. Boarding actions can lead to intense close-quarters combat and potentially decisive outcomes.

#### Sensors

A ship signals if it's using maneuver drive, weapons or active sensors. Drift is the absence of drives, weapons or
active sensors. Passive sensors retain drift.

You must detect a ship in order to target it. Passive sensors require no power. Active sensors require one point. You
can allocate additional points from your Power Plant to improve active sensors, with each point boosting your attempt by
one shift.

#### Movement

You may allocate points from your ships Power Plant, up to your maneuver drive rating, to change speed by up to that
amount.

#### Targeting

You may allocate turrets, bays or both and the respective points from you ship's Power Plant for targeting. You may
allocate a mount either for targeting or point defense or both, but each requires a separate power point allocation.

CPR/EPR turrets also have a fixed amount of ammunition, typically rated at ten times the tonnage, or 100 times for
fighters. 1000 rounds are exhausted with each attack or point defense. Any number of missiles may be fired in an attack
or interception, and a typical compliment is tonnage divided by 10.

Choose targets from surface and interior. Surface targets bypass armor, but not countermeasures. Surface targets include
weapon (bay or turret), fuel or maneuver drive. Interior targets include crew, sensors, computer, power plant and jump
drive, but the damage must penetrate the armor. A hit that penetrates by twice the armor value perforates the target and
renders the ship inoperable or potentially destroyed. A hit that has zero shifts after penetration vents the interior
atmosphere, but doesn't do damage to interior targets otherwise.

##### Targeting Difficulty

|               | Near       | Close Orbit | Far Orbit  | Extreme    |
|---------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **10 Tons**   | Routine    | Formidable  | Impossible | Futile     |
| **100 Tons**  | Trivial    | Routine     | Formidable | Impossible |
| **1000 Tons** | Effortless | Trivial     | Routine    | Formidable |

Note - you do not roll targeting for missiles, but they need to reach the target and if so, automatically hit.

#### Countermeasures

You may allocate turrets, bays or both and the respective points from you ship's Power Plant for point defense. You may
allocate a mount for targeting or point defense or both, but each requires a separate power point allocation.

Targeting an incoming missile is Routine (2, Space Combat) at up to three hexes in Near scale, or Easy (-1, Space
Combat) in an adjacent hex. Nuclear warheads still do shift -2 damage when destroyed adjacent to the target.

Plasma weapons can also generate a screen, adding a shift value of 3 that functions as armor even for surface targets.

#### Resolution

Once hits and countermeasures are determined, resolve damage. Surface hits ignore armor, but interior hits are reduced
by the armor value. Nuclear warheads that hit a surface target also deal shift -2 damage to an interior target. Nuclear
warheads are fusion or enhanced radiation, both are hazardous to equipment, but enhanced radiation does shift +2 damage
to crew, but only if it penetrates the hull. Particle accelerators will perforate the ship if they penetrate the armor.

##### Weapon Values

| Type                     | Mount  | Hexes | Damage Shifts | Power |
|--------------------------|--------|-------|---------------|-------|
| **CPR/EPR**              | Turret | 1     | 1             | 1     |
| **Missile**              | Bay    | 2/ 6  | 2             | 2     |
| **Plasma Weapon**        | Spinal | 10    | 3             | 3/ 1  |
| **Particle Accelerator** | Spinal | ∞     | 4             | 4/ 2  |

See Missiles above for movement. For Plasma Weapons and Particle Accelerators to maintain course, they must allocate
power to the maneuver drive momentarily to compensate. Otherwise they change velocity in the opposite direction of the
mount by the Power amount in hexes.

##### Armor Values

| Armor                                 | Shifts      |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| Hardened Composite                    | Average (1) |
| Electromagnetically Charged Composite | Fair (2)    |
| Coherent                              | Good (3)    |
| Electromagnetically Charged Coherent  | Great (4)   |

- Hardened composite is a hardened alloy with ceramic hull.
- EMC Composite is a hardened composite that is electromagnetically charged, reactive armor, increasing the ability of
  the armor to defect a blast or penetration.
- Coherent armor is a hardened composite that has had its structure partially collapsed in a super high density field,
  increasing the armor's density and strength.
- EMC Coherent is electromagnetically charged, reactive, coherent armor.

#### Boarding and EVA Phase

If the ships are adjacent, ships may engage in boarding actions or EVA. This may shift to Personal Combat.
