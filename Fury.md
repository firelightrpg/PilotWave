## Overview
The Fury is an Endurance class freighter, originally constructed by Dosjin Transport Inc with a crew of four (bridge, engineer, steward/ medical, gunner), up to eight, although can be operated by AI (Satori) with no crew. The ship has a two-tilt-engine maneuver drive and J2 rated WHIP drive. This ship has radio and laser communications and 15,000 km EMS active and 1.5 km passive sensors. The ship is also equipped with 1.5 km EMS jammers. The ship has dorsal and tail plasma guns with a third turret mounted under the bow with a particle accelerator for debarkation clearing. The dorsal and tail turrets have point defense targeting modules installed. The ship also has two external missile launch systems, each armed with four HE and four nuclear missiles. The cargo hold is 210 tons and supports up to 30 passengers in low berth.

Each area is outfitted with internal sensors and communications consoles, all networked to the ships data store, servers and AI. The sick bay is outfitted with an automed, capable of intensive surgery and genetic modification.
