## Overview
The Fury is an Endurance class freighter, originally constructed by Dosjin Transport Inc with a crew of four (bridge, engineer, steward/ medical, gunner), up to eight, although can be operated by AI (Satori) with no crew. The ship has a two-tilt-engine maneuver drive and J2 rated WHIP drive. This ship has radio and laser communications and 15,000 km EMS active and 1.5 km passive sensors. The ship is also equipped with 1.5 km EMS jammers. The ship has dorsal and tail plasma guns with a third turret mounted under the bow with a particle accelerator for debarkation clearing. The dorsal and tail turrets have point defense targeting modules installed. The ship also has two external missile launch systems, each armed with four HE and four nuclear missiles. The cargo hold is 210 tons and supports up to 30 passengers in low berth.

Each area is outfitted with internal sensors and communications consoles, all networked to the ships data store, servers and AI. The sick bay is outfitted with an automed, capable of intensive surgery and genetic modification.

## Upper Deck

### Hangar

The topmost level of Fury is taken up by the shuttle bay. There is room for a single 30 ton skiff and complete facilities for repairing and refueling the craft. The bay doors are in the ceiling of the chamber, retracting to fore and aft for launch (at which time the bay is open to space).

The lower wing position of the new hull design required Fury’s large side air locks to be offset a few feet above the main deck. As a result the shuttle bay has raised areas in the forward corners. A short ladder leads up to each platform which provides a view to either side of the ship (the windows were also raised). These elevated areas serve no other function than to accommodate the air lock areas on the deck below.

A small hatch at the forward end of the shuttle bay leads down to the main deck. There is an identical hatch above that provides turret access or, if the turret has been moved aside, leads to the exterior of the ship. A utility room at the aft end of the hangar bay has stairs leading down to the main deck. There are storage rooms on either side of the aft end of the room – used for maintenance equipment and EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) gear. Smaller lockers hold personal effects, flight suits, and various camping and survey gear – including a couple of sidearms and a hunting rifle. 

If the shuttle is removed, this area can be used to haul an additional 200 register tons of cargo. When this is done the shuttle is either left at dock or magnetically clamped to the hull exterior (usually over the closed bay doors).


### Support Room

The equipment in this room maintains and controls the life support systems (air, water, and heat) onboard the ship. The stairs lead directly down to the crew’s lounge.


## Main Deck


### Bridge

There are five dedicated crew stations on the bridge though the ship can be flown efficiently with just three personnel present. Communications only needs to be manned when the comm is in use, and the last area is a gunnery station that also serves as a redundant sensor system and computer access point.

The front of the room has three large windows, presenting a good view of the field ahead. The ship’s primary sensor and communications systems are also in the bow of the ship and can be accessed through wall and ceiling panels in this room.


### Bridge Cabin

The design of this ship places quarters adjacent to the bridge so that an operator can quickly take control when needed. The spartan room contains a bed, workstation, walk-in closet and private bathroom facilities.


### Conference Room

A large metal table surrounded by chairs fills the side chamber. A large view screen, wired into controls on the table, is at one end. There is a computer station in the main part of the room but the room is otherwise kept clear as this is also the primary route to the bridge.

A large storage closet holds administrative files and various office supplies. The adjacent bathroom is provided so that the bridge crew doesn’t have to walk the length of the ship to use the common facilities.

There is a round, hatch-like panel built into the floor at the forward end of the conference room. This provides access to the bow turret. The space below is the maintenance space for the primary communications array.


### Horticulture

Just forward of the airlock on the port side is a small workroom that has been converted into an indoor garden. An assortment of metal bins and tubs have been filled with potting soil and support a variety of vegetables and flowering plants. Sprayers and grow lights hang from the ceiling and there is often water puddled on the floor.


### Main Deck Airlocks

There are large air locks on either side of the main deck. On Fury, these are used primarily to load cargo into the auxiliary bay while the locks on the passenger level are used for crew and paying customers. When on land there is no easy way to access these air locks. It’s up to the docking facility to have a cargo gangway or other loading mechanism. The modernized hull design has these air locks set higher in the hull than before and so there are a few stairs leading up to the port-side one and a short ramp leading up to the other.


### Workshop

This area is used as a general purpose workshop and contains a dense collection of electronics and mechanical equipment. The workstation and shop table can be used to perform any sort of small repair or construction project. Like the garden, this alcove is open to the hallway outside. 


### Auxiliary Cargo Bay

The cargo bay on the main deck is used to hold general ships stores and other non-commercial freight (replacement parts, food stuffs, and even personal belongings). Maximum capacity is 70 tons. It will occasionally be used to hold overflow commercial freight or last minute shipments. Otherwise the room is a combination attic, pantry, and garage all piled into one area. There are smaller closets lining the hallways on this deck as well. These hold clothing, cleaning supplies, and other small miscellaneous items.


### Crew Quarters

The middle of the main deck contains four cabins dedicated to crew quarters. Three of these rooms have bunk beds and the last a single. Every cabin has been home to its occupants for many years and so is thick with personal effects and memorabilia.


### Restroom

The four crew cabins share a common restroom. Note that there is a small shower on the starboard side just forward of the crew’s lounge. This is used when there is a full load of passengers aboard. Otherwise the crew will generally use the larger shower facilities on the passenger level.


### Crew Lounge

This long, narrow room is cozy and comfortably furnished. Soft lighting, plants, tasteful decorations, and carpets help to soften the usual “metal and rust” décor. The starboard side holds a wooden dining table while the other end of the room has a gaming table (usually covered with a game in-progress). In between is a worn couch situated before a wall-mounted video screen.


### Escape Pods

There are four escape pods accessible along either side of the crew’s lounge. These Niagara-class pods are small, single person vehicles designed for a long stay and single reentry. The pod has no piloting controls and operates automatically using data from the ship’s main computer at the time of launch.

A single person can survive up to 6 days inside one of these pods. It might be possible to fit two people inside one, but there is only one seat and the ride can get pretty rough. The interior of the pods is not mapped out as it contains nothing more than a well padded chair (with five-point harness and built-in toilet) and basic controls for the comm and sensors. 

While the shuttle can be used as a lifeboat, Fury doesn’t have enough capacity to off load both crew and passengers in the event of a catastrophic failure. This fact is usually glossed over when taking on potential passengers. 


### Sick Bay

Like all Endurance-class vessels, Fury has a well stocked medical bay. There is a combination examination/operation chair on one side of a partition and a recovery area on the other. A locked closet holds a variety of medical gear and medicines. 


### Kitchen

The kitchen has a large walk-in refrigeration unit, a large stove & grill, a mass rehydration unit, and a sizable oven. While freeze-dried food is the normal fare on this type of ship, the “home cooking” aboard Fury has become one of its selling points to potential passengers.


### Engine Room

Nestled in the bowels of the engine, this hot, noisy chamber allows direct access to the drive core and power system. Supply closets on either side hold a variety of tools and small replacement parts. Panels in the walls and ceiling can be removed to allow access to even more obscure mechanical apparatus. A hatch in the floor leads directly to the engineering corridor that runs beneath the chamber.



## Troop Deck and Lower Deck (Cargo Bay)
![alt_text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Kj9ZvRkSP0E5jnWFwFmn_K-b2YEHmme7 "Lower decks")

## Troop Deck


### Showers and Restroom

The front end of the troop deck is taken up by a large communal restroom and shower area. Further forward on the port side is access to the ladder which runs from the top to the bottom of the hull - with pressure hatches at each deck and the exterior. The matching room on the starboard side is a supply closet.

A couch and video unit have been set up in the small area outside of the restroom, providing a little more relaxation space in the otherwise cramped quarters.


### Low Berth Rack

The passenger cabins are equipped to transport passengers in cryogenic sleep. There are four rooms with a total of 28 cryo berths between them. Each berth has an accompanying locker.

There are two additional small private rooms, each with a single berth. These are set aside for officers. There is a single shower near the mess hall set aside for officer use, but they do not have a separate toilet facility.


### Mess Hall

A passenger lounge and mess hall is set up for dining after waking with additional tables and seating. Meals still must be brought down from the kitchen on the main deck. A couch, video screens, and lockers with game supplies and sundries allow this area to function as an off duty lounge as well.


### Aft End

The aft end of the deck is the same as in Fury and the newer Endurance-class freighters. There is a laundry room and small gym just aft of the mess hall. A cramped corridor leads back through the guts of the engine to the aft garage. Above the garage is the rear-facing observation lounge and access to the tail gunner turret.


## Cargo Deck


### Main Hold

The belly of Fury is a single large cargo area 65 feet long and 50 feet across. The ceiling is only 9 feet high, which seems claustrophobic low given the depth of the room. 

Well packed, the main hold can carry 300 tons of cargo. Even though they are reminiscent of a parking lot, the lines on the floor are just guides to help with inventory tracking. 

At the forward end of the hold are a pair of heavy bay doors. These slide open to allow access to the airlock beyond. The exterior door on the other side of the lock lowers to act as a ramp. There is also a personnel hatch (with standard couplings) that can be accessed from the lock area. It leads down out the bottom of the ship, and up to the troop deck. When grounded, the exterior hatch is not usable.

Note that the main doorway is just high enough to allow a shuttle into the hold, though doing so while in flight would be extremely risky (and would also mean venting the entire hold to space).


### Aft Hold

A step up from the main hold brings one into the aft cargo area. From here stairs lead up, through a pressure door, to the passenger lounge. There is room for up to 30 tons of cargo in this area.

There are small “vaults” (reinforced closets with electronic locks) along either wall – 4 on each side. These are used to transport sensitive goods and passenger valuables. A few of these units also have environmental controls built in.


## Ship’s Complement

## Patrol Skiff, Rover and Tank, side view
![alt_text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Kg-QCVe2-39KhH36_BbYIc48iADfWP14 "Complement, side-view")

The Fury carries a single Morgan class shuttle in the hangar bay. The Morgan class is a very common model of light shuttle and is used by law enforcement patrols in many areas.

This particular craft has seats for a pilot and copilot plus four passengers and the patrol version adds a turreted pair of lasers and a small, internal missile bay. The turret is controlled from the copilot station. The missiles can be launched by either the captain or copilot. They drop out of the bottom of the ship before igniting and flying off towards their intended target.


### G4 Rover

The ship comes with a G4 Rover all-terrain vehicle as a support craft. 

This four wheeled ground vehicle is sturdy, reliable, and affordable – perfect for no-frills working ships like the Renegade and Endurance class transports. The G series off road buggy was originally built for racing and recreation, but it didn’t take long for it to be adapted for other uses. With the addition of a roof mounted turret, the G4 became popular with militias and military units on a tight budget. A Rover can handle a wide variety of ground terrain. It is, however, open to the elements and so environmental suits are required if the theater of operation is not amicable to human life.

The G4 features a unique 3rd seat situated behind and above the usual pair of front seats for the driver and passenger. This extra station can be used for an additional passenger, a “spotter” during cross country races, or a gunner.

The position is very exposed, lacking even a roll bar, and so is sometimes jokingly called the “suicide seat”.

The mounted weapon is a pulse gun in a plastic housing drawing from the vehicle’s power plant to recharge a built-in capacitor. A small but rechargeable capacitor allows for a large number of brief engagements rather than a single drawn out fight. 


### Aries-class Hover Tank

To efficiently deploy forces for recon or combat duties, the patrol skiff and all terrain buggy are well suited for reconnaissance. To bolster lethality, a pair of Aries-class hover tanks are carried in the main hold. Diagnostic, maintenance, and recharging equipment has been built into the hold floor and ceiling while extra mag locks have been installed to hold these massive vehicles in place during transport.

This heavily armored vehicle uses vectored thrust to move at considerable speed while staying 2-6 feet above the ground. The Aries mounts a powerful quantum plasma cannon as its main gun and carries four side-mounted missiles as well. These can fire both surface to surface or surface to air.

In addition, a gauss rifle (capable of single shot or  automatic fire) and grenade launcher are mounted atop the turret. Either weapon can be aimed and fired from inside the tank, though the automatic rifle is better utilized by a gunner with the hatch open if the situation allows. The grenade launcher carries a dozen rounds. It is used to blanket an area with anti-personnel blasts or smoke bombs. It takes a crew of two to properly man this vehicle: a driver and a gunner. It can be fully manned with a commander and forward observer.
